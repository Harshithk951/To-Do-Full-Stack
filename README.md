Welcome to the frontend of my To-Do Dashboard application! This repository contains the complete user-facing client, built with React. It provides a clean, responsive, and intuitive interface for users to securely manage their tasks.

### üöÄ Live Demo

The application is fully deployed and stable. You can test the live version here:

**‚û°Ô∏è [https://to-do-full-stack-tudm.vercel.app](https://to-do-full-stack-tudm.vercel.app)**

### üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

This is the frontend client within a complete full-stack architecture. It is decoupled from the backend, communicating via a RESTful API. This separation of concerns is a modern web development best practice.

*   **This Frontend (Client)**: Built with React and deployed on **Vercel**.
*   **Backend API**: **https://github.com/Harshithk951/todo-backend.git**

`[React Frontend on Vercel] <--- HTTPS Requests ---> [Node/Express API on Render] <--- SSL Connection ---> [MySQL Database on Aiven]`

### ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Secure User Authentication**: Full registration and login flow using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). User sessions are securely managed, and the UI dynamically adapts based on login status.
*   **Protected Routes**: The main dashboard is a protected route, accessible only after a successful login, ensuring user data privacy.
*   **Dynamic To-Do Management**: A full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface allows authenticated users to manage their personal to-do lists in real-time.
*   **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be functional and visually appealing across all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
*   **Environment-Driven Configuration**: The API URL is loaded from environment variables (`REACT_APP_API_URL`), meaning no hardcoded secrets and seamless transition between local development and production.
