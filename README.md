Welcome to the frontend of my full-stack To-Do Dashboard! This is the user-facing side of the application, built with React to be fast, responsive, and intuitive. My goal was to create a seamless user experience for managing daily tasks.

### See it Live! üöÄ

The best way to experience the project is to use it. The live application is deployed on Vercel:

### The Big Picture: A Full-Stack Application

This isn't just a standalone app; it's the client-side of a complete architecture. It handles the user interface and communicates securely with a dedicated backend API.

*   **This Frontend (The "Storefront")**: Built with React and deployed on Vercel.
*   **The Backend (The "Engine Room")**: **[‚û°Ô∏è Link to Your Backend GitHub Repository Here]**

`[React on Vercel] <---> [Node/Express API on Render] <---> [MySQL DB on Aiven]`

### Features I'm Proud Of

*   **Secure JWT Authentication**: Full user registration and login flow, ensuring all user data is protected.
*   **Dynamic User Dashboards**: Once logged in, users have a private space where they can manage their own to-do items.
*   **Full CRUD Functionality**: A smooth and responsive interface for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting tasks.
*   **Environment-Aware**: Connects to the live backend using environment variables, a best practice for security and deployment flexibility.

### Tech Stack

*   **Core**: React, React Router
*   **Styling**: [Mention what you used: Custom CSS, Material-UI, etc.]
*   **Deployment**: Vercel

### Want to Run This on Your Own Machine?

Here‚Äôs how you can get the frontend running locally. (You'll need the [backend server]([Link to Your Backend GitHub Repository Again]) running, too!)

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [Your Frontend Repository URL Here]
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the directory and install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd [your-frontend-repo-name]
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the root folder and add the following line. This tells the app to talk to your local backend server.
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
    ```
4.  **Launch the app!**
    ```sh
    npm start
     ```
